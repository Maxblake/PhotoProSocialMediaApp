Week 1

Formed a group, and I joined Jira which was created by Peter, the scrum master. I did my portion of user stories. 

Week 2

Started creating story boards. We compared the user stories, and removed any overlapping ones. As a group we also allocated priorities and Ids to each of the user stories. The refined user stories were then uploaded onto Jira. 

Week 3

We finished the storyboards and had our first scrum meeting. We allocated each member one user story each. The user story I'm doing is 1.8, viewing bookmarked images. I will watch the react videos to get a better understanding of react and begin coding soon.
