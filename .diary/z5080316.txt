Week 1:
Created a set of user stories based on my section taken from the project objectives/overview document. Had a look at the CSESoc frontend and backend personal projects to get an idea of how to use Firebase and React.

Week 2:
Reviewed the user stories made by everyone and compared them to choose which ones to keep and modify. I also assigned priorities and numbers to each user story before they were placed into the team Jira.

Week 3:
I took on US 1.9 Viewing watermarked version, after we did a scrum meeting to choose the difficulty of User stories and choose which ones to include in the current sprint. I also edited the proposal report and completed the sections on the business layer, the project objectives mapping to user stories, as well as references and general document formatting.

Week 4:
After some help from Peter, I was able to get a basic watermarked version to appear in the user's feed based on whether they had purchased it or not

Week 5:
I was able to fully generate and store the watermarked versions of images, whenever a user uploads a new image. The watermarked version is downloaded from the api site and is then uploaded to firebase, and its URL stored in the post's imageURLWatermarked attribute.
